# Discord Bot

A discord bot I made for use on my personal discord

Feel free to use as a basis for your own bot.

## Using for your own server

This program uses the [Discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) module. 

You must add a file named token.txt to the project folder where the first line
must be your Bot's token and the second line must be your servers token.

*Get bot token from https://discord.com/developers/* <br />
*Server token can be found in your servers settings on discord*

Linux users may be able to install the correct module and run the program using run.sh
